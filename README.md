# Hi, I'm [TeÃ¯lo Millet](https://github.com/teilomillet) ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm an aspiring developer and AI enthusiast, continually learning and exploring the realms of artificial intelligence and software development. My journey is currently focused on understanding and experimenting with open-source models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

Notably, my work with the [MiniMerlin](https://huggingface.co/teilomillet/MiniMerlin-3B) model, part of the [Merlin](https://huggingface.co/collections/teilomillet/merlin-659957c72ca1fbfe1c6239d0) series, aimed to create efficient, low-memory personal assistants. These POC models, built on architectures like Llama 2 and Mistral, integrate role-play, language learning, and strive to preserve pre-trained knowledge.

Parallel to this, the [Potato](https://huggingface.co/collections/teilomillet/potato-65995835eabe0f3e98b7937b) series, inspired by the adaptability of Mr. Potato, focuses on the merging of model's task vectors to create versatile and capable AI systems. My ongoing journey in AI is marked by constant learning and experimentation, aiming to contribute efficient and effective models for various applications.

I'm always interested in exploring new opportunities and collaborations in the AI field.

## I'm Currently Working On
- **Model Integration**: Fine-tuning and merging diverse open-source models, spanning from role-playing applications to new language implementation.
- **Dataset Development**: Crafting specialized datasets for LLM training, tailored to specific tasks and goals.
- **Tool Creation**: Building innovative tools to streamline the development and deployment of specialized datasets in AI.


## I'm Currently Learning
- **LLM Architecture**: Diving deep into the architecture of Large Language Models to understand and optimize their functionality.
- **Specialization Techniques**: Researching methods to improve the specialization of LLMs, aiming for higher efficiency and accuracy.
- **Programming Languages**: Expanding my coding arsenal with Rust and Mojo.
